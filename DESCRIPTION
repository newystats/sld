Description: The quantile-based skew logistic distribution is a quanitle defined generalisation of the logstic distribution.  This package provides random numbers, quantiles, probabilities, densities for the distribution.  It provides the density function, distribution function and Quantile-Quantile plots.  It provides methods of L-Moments estimation for the distribution.
