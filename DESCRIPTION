Description: The skew logistic distribution is a quantile-defined generalisation
 of the logistic distribution (van Staden and King 2015).  Provides random 
 numbers, quantiles, probabilities, densities and density quantiles for the distribution.
 It provides Quantile-Quantile plots and method of L-Moments estimation 
 (including asymptotic standard errors) for the distribution.
